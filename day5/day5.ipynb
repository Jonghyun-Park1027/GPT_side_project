Here‚Äôs a basic guide to making fresh pasta dough:\\n\\n### Ingredients:\\n- 2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour (or tipo \\\"00\\\" flour for a more authentic texture)\\n- 3 large eggs\\n- A pinch of salt\\n- A tablespoon of olive oil (optional)\\n\\n### Equipment:\\n- Mixing bowl\\n- Fork or dough whisk\\n- Rolling pin or pasta machine\\n- Sharp knife or pasta cutter\\n- Baking sheets\\n- Clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap\\n- Flour for dusting\\n\\n### Instructions:\\n\\n1. **Prepare the Dough:**\\n   - On a clean work surface, pour the flour into a mound. Make a well in the center of the flour and crack the eggs into it. If using a bowl, place the flour in and create a well in the middle.\\n   - Add salt and olive oil to the eggs (if using).\\n   - Using a fork, gently beat the eggs, gradually incorporating the flour starting from the inner rim of the well. Continue until the mixture is too stiff to mix with a fork.\\n\\n2. **Knead the Dough:**\\n   - Bring the dough together with your hands, incorporating the remaining flour.\\n   - Knead the dough by pressing it with the heel of your hand, folding it over, and turning it repeatedly for about 8-10 minutes until it‚Äôs smooth and elastic. The dough should be pliable and slightly sticky.\\n   - Wrap the dough in plastic wrap or cover it with a towel and let it rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. This allows the gluten to relax, making it easier to roll out.\\n\\n3. **Roll Out the Dough:**\\n   - Divide the rested dough into quarters. Keep the pieces you aren‚Äôt currently using covered to prevent them from drying out.\\n   - Dust a working surface and rolling pin (or pasta machine) with flour. Flatten a piece of dough slightly with your hands, then roll it out using a rolling pin or pass it through the pasta machine, starting with the thickest setting.\\n   - Continue rolling it through the machine, gradually reducing the thickness settings, until the pasta reaches your desired thickness. If using a rolling pin, roll from the center outwards, rotating the dough frequently.\\n\\n4. **Cut the Pasta:**\\n   - Once rolled out, dust the pasta sheet lightly with flour to prevent sticking.\\n   - Roll the sheet into a log shape and slice it into strips of your desired width (e.g., fettuccine, tagliatelle).\\n   - Unroll the strips and lay them flat or in small nests on a floured surface or baking sheet.\\n\\n5. **Cook the Pasta:**\\n   - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.\\n   - Add the pasta and cook for 2-4 minutes until al dente. Fresh pasta cooks more quickly than dried pasta.\\n   - Drain the pasta and toss it with your favorite sauce or simply with olive oil, Parmesan, and fresh herbs.\\n\\n### Tips:\\n- If the dough feels too dry while kneading, wet your hands lightly and continue to knead. If it's too sticky, incorporate a little more flour as needed.\\n- You can use semolina flour for dusting, which gives the pasta a nice texture and prevents sticking.\\n- Experiment with adding spinach, tomato paste, or herbs to the dough for flavored and colored variations.\\n\\nEnjoy your homemade Italian pasta!\",\n",

       "AIMessage(content='Making Italian pasta from scratch is a rewarding and relatively simple process. Here‚Äôs a basic guide to making fresh pasta dough:\\n\\n### Ingredients:\\n- 2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour (or tipo \"00\" flour for a more authentic texture)\\n- 3 large eggs\\n- A pinch of salt\\n- A tablespoon of olive oil (optional)\\n\\n### Equipment:\\n- Mixing bowl\\n- Fork or dough whisk\\n- Rolling pin or pasta machine\\n- Sharp knife or pasta cutter\\n- Baking sheets\\n- Clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap\\n- Flour for dusting\\n\\n### Instructions:\\n\\n1. **Prepare the Dough:**\\n   - On a clean work surface, pour the flour into a mound. Make a well in the center of the flour and crack the eggs into it. If using a bowl, place the flour in and create a well in the middle.\\n   - Add salt and olive oil to the eggs (if using).\\n   - Using a fork, gently beat the eggs, gradually incorporating the flour starting from the inner rim of the well. Continue until the mixture is too stiff to mix with a fork.\\n\\n2. **Knead the Dough:**\\n   - Bring the dough together with your hands, incorporating the remaining flour.\\n   - Knead the dough by pressing it with the heel of your hand, folding it over, and turning it repeatedly for about 8-10 minutes until it‚Äôs smooth and elastic. The dough should be pliable and slightly sticky.\\n   - Wrap the dough in plastic wrap or cover it with a towel and let it rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. This allows the gluten to relax, making it easier to roll out.\\n\\n3. **Roll Out the Dough:**\\n   - Divide the rested dough into quarters. Keep the pieces you aren‚Äôt currently using covered to prevent them from drying out.\\n   - Dust a working surface and rolling pin (or pasta machine) with flour. Flatten a piece of dough slightly with your hands, then roll it out using a rolling pin or pass it through the pasta machine, starting with the thickest setting.\\n   - Continue rolling it through the machine, gradually reducing the thickness settings, until the pasta reaches your desired thickness. If using a rolling pin, roll from the center outwards, rotating the dough frequently.\\n\\n4. **Cut the Pasta:**\\n   - Once rolled out, dust the pasta sheet lightly with flour to prevent sticking.\\n   - Roll the sheet into a log shape and slice it into strips of your desired width (e.g., fettuccine, tagliatelle).\\n   - Unroll the strips and lay them flat or in small nests on a floured surface or baking sheet.\\n\\n5. **Cook the Pasta:**\\n   - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.\\n   - Add the pasta and cook for 2-4 minutes until al dente. Fresh pasta cooks more quickly than dried pasta.\\n   - Drain the pasta and toss it with your favorite sauce or simply with olive oil, Parmesan, and fresh herbs.\\n\\n### Tips:\\n- If the dough feels too dry while kneading, wet your hands lightly and continue to knead. If it\\'s too sticky, incorporate a little more flour as needed.\\n- You can use semolina flour for dusting, which gives the pasta a nice texture and prevents sticking.\\n- Experiment with adding spinach, tomato paste, or herbs to the dough for flavored and colored variations.\\n\\nEnjoy your homemade Italian pasta!', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 704, 'prompt_tokens': 13, 'total_tokens': 717, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_07871e2ad8', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BqD5LVWZrdyGBoVCJIkEAETvWYWd0', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run--fa4a29ce-50cf-4b5d-a3a5-078d8612941d-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 13, 'output_tokens': 704, 'total_tokens': 717, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})"
