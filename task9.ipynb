      "Invoking: `SaveResearchFile` with `{'content': 'XZ Backdoor: “That was a close one” | Xygeni\\n\\nBackdooring SSH\\nA nefarious or compromised maintainer inserted malicious behavior in a library named liblzma, part of the xz compression tools and libraries, resulting in a backdoor in SSH. This is an advanced software supply chain attack as the library was intentionally modified for the backdoor, with obfuscation and stealth techniques for hiding the attack payload from reviewers. It was discovered and disclosed recently (on past Mar 29th), and the attack handling is ongoing. However, it was quickly contained as it seems to affect only pre-release versions of a limited set of environments (DEB and RPM packages, for the x86_64 architecture, and built with GCC). Anyway, the CVE was given a CVSS base score of 10, which is reserved for the most critical cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Should it enter stable distributions, the impact would be overwhelming. The technical analysis of the attack, including the xz backdoor explained in depth, was analyzed elsewhere. This post will focus on the timeline of the attack, how it could be detected, how the incident was handled up to date, and what lessons may be extracted from the attack. How the XZ backdoor was injected Note: The git repository is in git.tukaani.org. However, there was also a GitHub hosted repository (currently blocked) where the GitHub account was posting the changes that were later integrated into the Git repository. One portion of the backdoor seems to be only in the distributed tarballs for the 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 versions, not in the git repositories and relies on a single line in the build-to-host.m4 macro file used by autoconf. The other portion was in two supposed testfiles bad-3-corrupt_lzma2.xz and good-large_compressed.lzma that were committed by the GitHub account “Jia Tan” (JiaT75) in the xz repository on 23 Feb. It was an innocuous change adding testfiles (supposedly .lzma and .xz compressed blocks). Interestingly enough, the test files were not used by the tests! The line in the .m4 file injects an obfuscated script (included in the tarball) to be executed at the end of configure if some conditions match. It modifies the Makefile for the liblzma library to contain code that extracts data from the .xz file, which after deobfuscation ends in this script, is invoked at the end of configure. It decides whether to modify the build process to inject code: only under GCC and the GCC linker, under Debian or rpm, and only for x86_64 Linux. When matched, the injected code intercepts execution by replacing two ifunc resolvers so certain calls are replaced. This causes the symbol tables to be parsed in memory (this takes time, which led to the detection, as explained later). Then things get interesting: The backdoor installs an audit hook into the dynamic linker, waiting for the RSA_public_decrypt function symbol to arrive, which is redirected to a point into the backdoor code, which in turn calls back libcrypto, presumably to perform normal authentication. And the payload activates if the running program has the process name /usr/sbin/sshd. It was clear that SSH servers were the target. Traditionally, sshd servers like OpenSSH were not linked with liblzma, but sshd is often patched to support systemd-notify so other services can start when sshd is running. And then liblzma is indirectly loaded by systemd, closing the circle. The backdoor is not yet fully analyzed, but it seems to be allowing remote command execution (RCE) with the privileges of the sshd daemon, running in a pre-authentication context. Info from the remote certificate, when matched by the backdoor, is decrypted with ChaCha20, and when it decrypts successfully it is passed to the system(). So this is essentially a gated RCE, much worse than a mere public key bypass. A later 5.6.1 tarball showed additional efforts to hide the traces, adding further obfuscation for symbol names, and trying to fix the errors seen. An extension mechanism where additional test files were looked for certain signatures to add to the backdoor was also put in place. This fairly sophisticated attack could pass unnoticed until stable Linux distributions are reached. Fortunately, some people like to check why abnormal things happen.'}`\n",

      "A nefarious or compromised maintainer inserted malicious behavior in a library named liblzma, part of the xz compression tools and libraries, resulting in a backdoor in SSH. This is an advanced software supply chain attack as the library was intentionally modified for the backdoor, with obfuscation and stealth techniques for hiding the attack payload from reviewers. It was discovered and disclosed recently (on past Mar 29th), and the attack handling is ongoing. However, it was quickly contained as it seems to affect only pre-release versions of a limited set of environments (DEB and RPM packages, for the x86_64 architecture, and built with GCC). Anyway, the CVE was given a CVSS base score of 10, which is reserved for the most critical cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Should it enter stable distributions, the impact would be overwhelming. The technical analysis of the attack, including the xz backdoor explained in depth, was analyzed elsewhere. This post will focus on the timeline of the attack, how it could be detected, how the incident was handled up to date, and what lessons may be extracted from the attack. How the XZ backdoor was injected Note: The git repository is in git.tukaani.org. However, there was also a GitHub hosted repository (currently blocked) where the GitHub account was posting the changes that were later integrated into the Git repository. One portion of the backdoor seems to be only in the distrib ...\n",
